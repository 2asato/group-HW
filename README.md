Beer Bier Beoir Birra ~ Craft Beer Club

This app allows users to enter a beer club where they taste and write up different beers, learn about the different varietals in different regions, and see what their friends and others around the world are drinking. At the moment it is a one model full CRUD MEAN app with the ability to view all the beers people have written up, and create new reviews which they can also edit and delete.

Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node were used to create CRUD routes.

In time, at least 2 other model will be added, one for users including full authentication,and the other for posting to other's pages. Users can form groups, much like a social media site, and add to the app's growing wiki section.
